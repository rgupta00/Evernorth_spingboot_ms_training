Lab Assignment 2: Mongodb Queries 
-----------------------------------

Consider following json document :
-----------------------------
peaks.json
[

This document contains the following fields and values:
-------------------------------------------
name: the peak’s name
height: the peak’s elevation, in meters
location: the countries in which the mountain is located. 
	This field stores values as an array to allow for mountains located in more than one country
	
ascents: 
	this field’s value is another document.
	When one document is stored within another document like this, 
	it’s known as an embedded or nested document.
	Each ascents document describes successful ascents of the given mountain. 
	Specifically, each ascents document contains a total field that lists the
	total number of successful ascents of each given peak. 
	Additionally, each of these nested documents contain two fields whose values are also nested documents
	
	first: 
		this field’s value is a nested document that contains one field, 
		year, which describes the year of the first overall successful ascent
		
	first_winter: 
		this field’s value is a nested document that also contains a year field, 
		 the value of which represents the year of the first successful winter ascent
		 of the given mountain
		 
		 
1. create one mongodb database called peaksdb
2. create collections called peaks insert all documents mention above
4. Write Query to returns any documents whose name value is equal to Everest:
5. Write Query to searches for any documents whose name value does not equal Everest
6. Write Queries query searches for documents whose height value is greater than 8500
7.Write Queries to selecting a mountain that matches the name Everest and the exact height of 8848 meters:
8Write Queries to selecting a mountain that matches the name Everest or.  the exact height of 8848 meters:
9. Find mountains located in both China and Nepal?
10. Write query to found peek with more than 1000 ascents
